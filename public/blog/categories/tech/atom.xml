    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's interesting. It shows I still have a lot to learn. I don't need to know how
everything works exactly: I can treat it as a black box and still be productive.
But here's some things I need to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>CSS 3 including media queries, responsive design</li>
<li>Markdown: I know how to make links and lists, but that's about it.</li>
<li>Sass: A CSS compiler to make things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>How I updated the CSS</h2>

<p>I've never been very good at CSS. CSS3 with Sass is almost completely foreign to
me. Since responsive design is all the rage these days, I'll resist my
temptation to rip it all out and start from scratch, and gradually obtain an
understanding of it over time. In the meantime, the Sass is structured in a way
that lets you set customizations (colors, fonts) in a centralized place.</p>

<p>``` diff sass/<em>custom/</em>colors.scss
diff --git a/sass/custom/<em>colors.scss b/sass/custom/</em>colors.scss
index 740266a..bc80145 100644

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. This is a little different from other blog software.
Rather than being generated on the fly, and dependent on a database and application code, this
is a "static blog". I write and manage actual "post" files, and I run a command to generate the
HTML, CSS, the whole site. It's also a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repository, so I have the whole thing under source
control. And since it's a Git repository, I can push it to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, which is hosting this content.</p>

<p>It will take some getting used to, but it's a neat approach. It is absolutely more secure than a typical
Wordpress installation. It can be hosted for free or nearly free almost anywhere, since it's just static HTML.
It will be lightning fast, since it's just static HTML.</p>

<p>It's also an extreme approach: SSH keys, git repos... if I wasn't already well-versed in this, I would probably be frustrated.</p>

<p>Things I'm not so sure how to do, and should find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the CSS and make it feel different. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a>, which I'm not sure I'll comprehend right away.</li>
<li>How to embed images (where should they be hosted?)</li>
</ul>
