    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. This is a little different from other blog software.
Rather than being generated on the fly, and dependent on a database and application code, this
is a "static blog". I write and manage actual "post" files, and I run a command to generate the
HTML, CSS, the whole site. It's also a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repository, so I have the whole thing under source
control. And since it's a Git repository, I can push it to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, which is hosting this content.</p>

<p>It will take some getting used to, but it's a neat approach. It is absolutely more secure than a typical
Wordpress installation. It can be hosted for free or nearly free almost anywhere, since it's just static HTML.
It will be lightning fast, since it's just static HTML.</p>

<p>It's also an extreme approach: SSH keys, git repos... if I wasn't already well-versed in this, I would probably be frustrated.</p>

<p>Things I'm not so sure how to do, and should find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the CSS and make it feel different. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a>, which I'm not sure I'll comprehend right away.</li>
<li>How to embed images (where should they be hosted?)</li>
</ul>
