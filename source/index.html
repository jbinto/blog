<!-- Congratulations! You were curious enough to take a gander at my HTML.
     Like you, I'm always interested in looking at how things work behind
     the scenes. And I won't lie, I sometimes judge tech businesses based 
     on how clean their emitted HTML is. If I see a lot of commented out 
     markup, internal system details, or anything amiss, I dock them a point.
     Just one though. Attention to detail is one of my strongest values.

     The tools I used to build this page include:
     * Git
     * Amazon S3 (formerly: DigitalOcean / nginx) for storage
     * Amazon CloudFront for CDN and HTTPS reverse proxy
     * StartSSL for a free, 1-year SSL certificate
     * Vim/Sublime Text, as necessary
     * https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate
     * https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website

     The utter lack of CSS was a conscious design choice. 
     See http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ (not mine) for more on this choice.

     At some point, I will bite the bullet and do some design. But not today.

     This concludes your easter egg hunt. Better luck next year.

<p>Hi there. This is Jesse Buchanan's website. I'm a highly opinionated software developer (though my strong opinions are <a href="http://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">weakly held</a>). My current toolbox includes Rails, JavaScript and Linux, but in the past I've also used C#, ASP.NET (both webforms and MVC), Oracle, and Python.</p>

<p>I'm currently trying my hand at front-end development, including AngularJS and Ember.js. I don't believe in pigeon-holing myself into one or two technologies or platforms. I try to keep an open mind, and use the right tool for the job.</p>
