Hi, I'm Jesse Buchanan, aka "jbinto" on the internet. *(That's J-B, in T-O, as in Toronto, Ontario.)*

I'm a highly opinionated software developer. My current toolbox includes Rails, JavaScript and Linux, but in the past I've also used C#, ASP.NET (both webforms and MVC), Oracle, and Python. 

I'm interested in [open data projects](http://toronto.ca/open/). If you have any ideas you'd like to share, or if you'd just like to talk about technology, I'd love to chat. Go to [jessebuchanan.ca](http://jessebuchanan.ca) to find out how to contact me. 

This site was generated using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is a static blog generator written in Ruby. I've [shared the source code](http://github.com/jbinto/blog) on Github.
