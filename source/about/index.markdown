Hi, I'm Jesse. I'm a software developer born and raised in Toronto, Canada. 

I've always been interested in technology, and these days I'm focused on modern web technologies: Ruby (on Rails), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, etc. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive 9-week program at <a href="http://bitmakerlabs.com/">Bitmaker Labs</a>, in the Spring 2013 cohort. If you'd like to know more about me, <a href="http://jbinto.ca/resume">take a look at my resume</a>. 

This site was generated using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is a static blog generator written in Ruby. I've [shared the source code](http://github.com/jbinto/blog) of this site on Github.
